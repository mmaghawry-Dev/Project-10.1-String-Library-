# String Library Project  

ðŸ“Œ **Project Name:** String Library Project  
ðŸ“Œ **Language:** C++  
ðŸ“Œ **Concepts Used:**  
- Abstraction & Encapsulation  
- Constructor & Copy Constructor
- polymorphism  
- Static Methods  
- Function Overloading  
- Property Getters & Setters  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description  
This project is a custom **String Library** implemented in C++ that demonstrates important **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It provides functionality to manipulate and analyze strings, including:  
- Counting words  
- Converting cases (upper, lower, capitalize first letters)  
- Inverting cases  
- Counting specific types of characters  

The project also serves as a learning exercise in **OOP design**, showcasing abstraction, encapsulation, and method overloading.

## ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented  
- **Word Counting** â†’ Count how many words are in a given string.  
- **String Length** â†’ Get the length of the string.  
- **Case Manipulation** â†’  
  - Capitalize first letters of each word  
  - Convert whole string to upper case  
  - Convert whole string to lower case  
- **Inversion** â†’  
  - Invert all letters (upper â†” lower)  
  - Count inverted capital letters  
  - Count inverted small letters
- **Character Operations** â†’  
  - Count total letters  
  - Invert a specific character  
and others features

## ðŸ”¹ Here is some Examples of Outputs  

### Word Count 

---

### String Length & Case Conversion  

string1 = ali ahmad mohamed
String2 = mohamed maghawry shaaban

Number of words: 3
Number of words: 4
Number of words: 2

---

### Inversion & Character Operations  
karem Lami Ali

After invert all letters: kAREM lAMI aLI

After invert all Capital letters: 9

After invert all Small letters: 3

After Count all letters : 12

After invert c : c

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose of the Project  
The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate **C++ OOP concepts** through practical implementation in a **String Library**.  
It provides reusable methods and encapsulated logic that can be extended for larger applications.
